  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="images/Teresah.png.PNG" alt="Teresah Wanjiku" class="about-img">
    <p>I am <strong>Teresah Wanjiku</strong>, a cancer survivor, mental health advocate, and passionate leader. My journey through breast cancer opened my eyes to the often-overlooked mental and emotional toll of the illness.</p>
    <p>As I worked to rebuild my life, I realized the critical need for accessible emotional support for cancer patients and survivors. With this insight, I founded the <strong>Sprout and Live Hope Foundation</strong>.</p>
    <p>My mission is simple: to remind every patient that healing is not just physical—it’s also emotional and psychological.</p>

    <h3>Personal Journey</h3>
    <blockquote>
      “My battle with cancer transformed my life, igniting a passion to support those facing similar journeys. Overcoming this challenge showed me that cancer is not a death sentence; it’s an invitation to heal, grow, and live with purpose.”
    </blockquote>
